Speech-to-Text Model Fine-tuning: Requirements and To-Do List
This document outlines the requirements and a step-by-step plan for fine-tuning a speech-to-text (STT) model specifically for Spanish conversational audio, using data from popular Spanish podcasts.

1. Project Goal
The primary objective is to fine-tune an existing pre-trained speech-to-text model (specifically, the Whisper model, for which setup is already in place) to accurately transcribe conversational Spanish audio, with a particular focus on the style and vocabulary found in podcasts. The aim is to achieve high accuracy in transcribing natural, informal Spanish speech, including slang, colloquialisms, and diverse accents.

2. Data Acquisition
The success of fine-tuning heavily relies on the quality and quantity of the training data. This section focuses on creating the comprehensive dataset needed for fine-tuning.

Audio Sources:

Primary Source: Spotify podcasts, specifically: (If you can find other relevant podcasts, feel free to add them as well)

Requirement: Develop or utilize a method to extract high-quality audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV) from these podcasts. Consider tools or APIs that allow for programmatic access if direct download is not feasible.

Transcripts:

Requirement: Obtain accurate, time-aligned transcripts for each audio file.

Prioritize existing official transcripts if available (e.g., from podcast creators, Spotify's own transcript features if exportable).

If official transcripts are not available, consider:

Leveraging existing STT services (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe) to generate initial transcripts, followed by manual review and correction.

Crowdsourcing or manual transcription for highly accurate results, especially for conversational nuances.

Format: Transcripts should be in a plain text format, ideally synchronized with audio timestamps (e.g., VTT, SRT, or a simple text file per audio segment).

3. Data Preparation and Preprocessing (Dataset Creation Focus)
Clean and consistent data is crucial for effective model training. This section details the steps to create the fine-tuning dataset.

Audio Preprocessing:

Normalization: Ensure consistent audio levels across all files.

Resampling: Convert all audio to a uniform sampling rate (e.g., 16 kHz), which is common for many STT models like Whisper.

Format Conversion: Convert all audio to a consistent format (e.g., WAV).

Segmentation: Segment long audio files into shorter, manageable chunks (e.g., 5-30 seconds), aligning with natural pauses or speaker turns. Each segment should have a corresponding transcript.

Transcript Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Remove non-speech elements (e.g., "uhm," "like," laughter, background noise descriptions) unless specifically required for the model's output.

Punctuation and Capitalization: Decide on a consistent approach (e.g., normalize all text to lowercase, standardize punctuation). This depends on the target model's input requirements.

Speaker Diarization (Optional but Recommended): If the goal is to identify different speakers, transcripts should include speaker labels. This requires additional processing during data preparation.

Synchronization: Crucially, ensure that each audio segment has a perfectly aligned transcript. Misalignments will negatively impact training.

Dataset Structure:

The final dataset should be structured in a format compatible with Hugging Face's datasets library, typically as a collection of audio paths and their corresponding text transcripts. This might involve creating a JSON Lines file or similar.

Dataset Splitting:

Divide the prepared data into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test).

Ensure representative distribution of different speakers, topics, and audio qualities across all sets.

4. Model Selection and Environment Setup
The Whisper model setup is already in place. This section outlines the environment for dataset creation and fine-tuning.

Base Model Selection:

Whisper Model: The project will utilize the Whisper model for fine-tuning.

Development Environment:

Programming Language: Python (version 3.8+ recommended).

Libraries:

transformers (Hugging Face) for model loading and fine-tuning.

pytorch or tensorflow (depending on the chosen model's framework).

librosa or pydub for audio processing.

datasets (Hugging Face) for efficient data loading and preparation.

accelerate (Hugging Face) for distributed training if needed.

Compute: Access to a GPU (e.g., NVIDIA V100, A100, or consumer-grade GPUs like RTX 3080/4090) is highly recommended for efficient fine-tuning.

5. Fine-tuning Process
The core of the project involves adapting the pre-trained model to the specific dataset.

Configuration:

Define fine-tuning parameters: learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, scheduler.

Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Training Loop:

Load the pre-trained Whisper model and tokenizer.

Prepare data loaders for training and validation sets using the created dataset.

Iterate through epochs, performing forward and backward passes.

Save model checkpoints periodically.

Evaluation:

Regularly evaluate the model on the validation set during training.

Primary Metrics:

Word Error Rate (WER): The standard metric for STT, measuring the number of errors (substitutions, deletions, insertions) at the word level.

Character Error Rate (CER): Useful for languages with complex orthography or for assessing character-level accuracy.

Qualitative Assessment: Listen to sample transcriptions to identify common errors and areas for improvement.

6. Model Deployment and Inference
Once fine-tuned, the model should be ready for use.

Inference Pipeline: Develop a script or application to load the fine-tuned model and perform real-time or batch transcription on new Spanish audio.

API (Optional): Consider wrapping the model in a REST API for easy integration into other applications.

Optimization: Quantization or model pruning for faster inference if necessary.

7. Hugging Face Dataset Upload
Upon completion of the dataset creation and validation, the processed dataset will be uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub.

Requirements:

Hugging Face account and huggingface_hub library installed.

Dataset should be in a compatible format (e.g., DatasetDict object from the datasets library).

Appropriate metadata (description, license, language tags) should be prepared.

Process:

Authenticate with Hugging Face Hub.

Use dataset.push_to_hub() to upload the dataset.

Ensure proper versioning if updates are made.

8. Resource Requirements
Computational Resources:

GPU: Essential for reasonable training times. The more VRAM, the larger the batch size and model size can be.

CPU: Sufficient cores for data loading and preprocessing.

RAM: Enough memory to handle the dataset and model.

Storage:

Ample disk space for raw audio files, processed audio, transcripts, and model checkpoints (potentially hundreds of GBs to several TBs depending on data volume).

Time Commitment:

Data acquisition and preparation: Significant time investment.

Environment setup: Moderate.

Fine-tuning and experimentation: Iterative process, can take days to weeks depending on data size and desired accuracy.

This comprehensive plan should guide the fine-tuning process effectively.
