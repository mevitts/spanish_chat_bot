### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide (No Code Shown)

Your `Rules/frontend.txt` file indicates you'll need `Chat.jsx`, `Message.jsx`, and `AudioPlayer.jsx` components. We'll build these step-by-step.

### **Step 1: Understand React Components and JSX**

Every piece of your user interface will be a React component. These are essentially JavaScript functions that return JSX, which looks like HTML but allows you to embed JavaScript expressions.

- **Action:** Familiarize yourself with the basic structure of a React functional component and how it uses JSX to describe what the UI should look like.
- **Web Pointers (Search for):**
    - "React functional component tutorial"
    - "What is JSX in React"
    - "React props explained" (for passing data between components)
    - "React useState hook" (for managing component-specific data)

### **Step 2: Create the `Message` Component**

This component will likely display a single chat message, showing who sent it (user or bot) and the message text.

- **Action:**
    1. Inside `mevitts/spanish_chat_bot/spanish_chat_bot-feature-frontend/side_proj/frontend/src/components/`, create a new file named `Message.jsx`.
    2. Define a functional React component within this file.
    3. Consider what information a message needs (e.g., `text`, `sender`). These pieces of information will be passed into your `Message` component as "props."
    4. Design the basic structure for displaying a message using JSX, incorporating the props.
    5. Think about how to differentiate between messages from the user and messages from the bot (e.g., different styling based on the `sender` prop). This is where Tailwind CSS will be useful.

    - "Tailwind CSS text color"
    - "Tailwind CSS background color"

### **Step 3: Create the `AudioPlayer` Component**

This component will be responsible for playing audio responses from the bot.

- **Action:**
    1. Inside `mevitts/spanish_chat_bot/spanish_chat_bot-feature-frontend/side_proj/frontend/src/components/`, create a new file named `AudioPlayer.jsx`.
    2. Define a functional React component.
    3. This component will likely need a prop for the audio source (e.g., `audioUrl`).
    4. Think about how to use the HTML `<audio>` tag within JSX to play the audio. You might want to control playback (play, pause) within this component, which will involve using React's `useState` and potentially `useEffect` hooks.

    - "HTML audio tag in React"
    - "React useState hook for audio playback"
    - "React useEffect for side effects"

### **Step 4: Create the `Chat` Component**

This will be the main component that orchestrates the conversation, displaying messages, allowing user input, and interacting with your backend.

- **Action:**
    1. Inside `mevitts/spanish_chat_bot/spanish_chat_bot-feature-frontend/side_proj/frontend/src/components/`, create a new file named `Chat.jsx`.
    2. Define a functional React component.
    3. This component will need to manage the list of messages in the conversation. This data will be "state" within the `Chat` component.
    4. Render the `Message` components inside a container, iterating over your list of messages.
    5. Add an input field for the user to type their message and a button to send it.
    6. Think about how to capture user input (event handling) and update the component's state with new messages.
    7. Consider how to integrate the `AudioPlayer` for bot responses.

    - "React forms and input handling"
    - "React useState for managing arrays"
    - "Event handling in React"
    - "Tailwind CSS input styling"
    - "Tailwind CSS button styling"

### **Step 5: Integrate Axios for API Calls**

Your `Chat` component will need to send user messages to your backend and receive responses. Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests.

- **Action:**
    1. In your `Chat.jsx` component, think about where you will make the API call when the user sends a message. This will likely be within an event handler function.
    2. Import Axios into your `Chat.jsx` file.
    3. Formulate an Axios `POST` request to send the user's message to your backend endpoint.
    4. Handle the response from the backend. This response will likely contain the bot's message and potentially an audio URL.
    5. Update the `Chat` component's state with the new bot message and pass the audio URL to the `AudioPlayer` component.
    6. Consider error handling for API calls.

    - "Handling API responses in React"
    - "Async Await with Axios in React"
    - "React useEffect for fetching data"

### **Step 6: Update `App.jsx`**

Now that you have your individual components, you'll bring them together in `App.jsx`.

- **Action:**
    1. Open `mevitts/spanish_chat_bot/spanish_chat_bot-feature-frontend/side_proj/frontend/src/App.jsx`.
    2. Remove the existing demo content (the Vite and React logos, count button, etc.).
    3. Import your `Chat` component into `App.jsx`.
    4. Render the `Chat` component within `App.jsx`.
    5. Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the overall layout of your application if desired.
